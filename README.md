# MERN Book Search Engine

## Description
This project involves taking a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactoring it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Users enter a search term and then books related to the search term are rendered to the screen. If users are logged in, they may save book to their saved books list. They may also delete a book from the saved books list.
